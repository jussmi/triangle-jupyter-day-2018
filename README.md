# Everything I wish I knew sooner
Materials from my lightning talk "Everything I wish I knew sooner" at [Triangle Jupyter Day 2018](https://libcce.github.io/TriangleJupyter/)

The talk is centered around the features of Jupyter Notebooks I wish I had known sooner.
The topics covered include cell and line magics, recovering from mistakes, and shell commands from the notebook.

To work through the notebook:
  the Dockerfile can be used to build an image and run a container,
  or the repo can be cloned into an existing notebook tree running Python 3
